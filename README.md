### This launcher download, install your favorite anime game and dependecies for you!

For now, there is only a cli version of the launcher, but a gui one is on my radar, so stay tuned!

If you have any issue with the launcher, don't hesitate to open an issue!

## Requirement

Please install Rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr/tools/install)  
You need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system, but all major distro have it installed by default  
You need Wintricks to be installed to install the fonts and the dependecies for the game, you can install it via your package manager or your flatpack store  
You need Steam to be installed to run the game  

## Installation

To install the cli version of the launcher, just start this command :

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/ALEZ-DEV/Babylonia-terminal --bin
```

and you can just run it by doing :

```
babylonia-terminal-cli
```
