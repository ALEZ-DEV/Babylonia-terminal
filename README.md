### This launcher downloads and installs your favorite anime game and its dependencies for you!
For now, there is only a cli version of the launcher, but a gui one is on my radar, so stay tuned!  
If you have any issues with the launcher, don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/ALEZ-DEV/Babylonia-terminal/issues)!
