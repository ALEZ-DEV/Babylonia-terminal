# Babylonia terminal

### This launcher download, install your favorite anime game and dependecies for you!

For now, there is only a cli version of the launcher, but a gui one is on my radar, so stay tuned!

If you have any issue with the launcher, don't hesitate to open an issue!

## Requirement

Please install Rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr/tools/install)  
You need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system, but all major distro have it installed by default  
You need Steam to be installed to run the game  

## Installation

To install the cli version of the launcher, just start this command :

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/ALEZ-DEV/Babylonia-terminal --bin
```

and you can just run it by doing :

```
babylonia-terminal-cli
```
